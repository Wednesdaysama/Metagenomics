To find a specific protein sequence from a designed faa file:
blastp -query bicar_trans_seq_uniprot.fasta -subject Phormidium_alkaliphilum.faa -out alk_bica.txt
bicar_trans_seq_uniprot.fasta contained the specific protein sequences, which can be download from [uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/) for example.
Phormidium_alkaliphilum.faa is the designed file, which may conatain the whole protein sequence of one species.
